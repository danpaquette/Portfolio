    <p>
      Born and raised in the Toledo Region, technology has always been my passion. What started out as a fascination
      with computer games and design blossomed into a career that has spanned over a decade of hard, rewarding work.
      In that time, I've deployed websites for multiple organizations, launched my own company, created and nurtured
      community networking groups, taught children how to code, and formed some of the longest lasting friendships of my
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been a great pleasure serving with and working for the people and businesses of Toledo, and I hope to continue
      our legacy of grit, perseverance, and ability to overcome. In my free time, you'll find me at a local restaurant or attending
      one of our city's many local technology oriented events, which you can find at
      <a href="http://toledotechevents.org/">Toledo Tech Events</a>. See you there!

      In the wake of the 2011 <a href="http://techtoledo.com/">TechToledo</a> yearend meeting, my co-founder,
      <a href="https://gregmiller.io/">Greg Miller</a>, and I set out on a six year journey to create Toledo's first general
      purpose web, technology, and knowledge sharing community. After 80 events, hundreds of lives touched,
      countless connections made, and more, it's still our labor of love we carry out each month. With great speakers,
      panels, workshops, and more, we hope to see you there!
