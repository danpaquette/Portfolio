            Concurra posed a unique question: there are products for website analytics, heatmapping, click tracking,
            and A/B testing, but what happens when combine them all into one? Could we automatically make better, informed decisions
            about our websites and increase conversions? Concurra says yes.

        <p>
          Concurra's brand features a beautiful stylized 'C' wrapped in slices of a pie chart to tie in Concurra's
          data-centric methodology. Lato was the typeface of choice featuring classical letterforms with a modern twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Math &amp; Science icons including beakers, test tubes, equations, and microscopes are added to recall the mad
          scientist marketer creating hypotheses and conducting experiments.
